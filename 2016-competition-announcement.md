The first clue for `Level 0` will be released at least on our Twitter page of [@ircpuzzles](https://twitter.com/ircpuzzles). It may also be released or announced via the [freenode blog](https://blog.freenode.net/), freenode's twitter page [@freenodestaff](https://twitter.com/freenodestaff), freenode wallop, or freenode global announcement.

Join us in `#ircpuzzles` on [freenode.net](https://freenode.net/) and chat with everybody before, during, and even after the comptetition!

The prizes for completing this year have yet to be finalized and will most likely be group cloaks representing individual placement in the contest.

Good luck!
