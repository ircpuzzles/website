This is a running and non-comprehensive list of "Guidelines" or things to know that can help out.

 * Answers are channels you must join on freenode.
 * Once you think you have solved it, `/join ######YourAnswer`
 * All levels will always start with `######` (6-six) octothorpes.
 * The official channels will be registered to the IRC account of **ircpuzzles**.
 * You can quickly see if a channel exists with `/mode ######channel_name`
 * freenode channel names are *NOT* case sensitive.
 * The _clue_ is, by itself, the main puzzle for each level.
 * The _hints_ are to help point you in the right direction with the _clue_.
 * freenode's maximum channel name length is 50-characters (including the `#` hashes).


Important
---------

 * The _*ircpuzzles*_ account has the cloak _*@ircpuzzles/official*_
