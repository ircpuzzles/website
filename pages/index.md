Welcome to *#ircpuzzles*!

We are an IRC-based puzzle game. Our home is currently in *#ircpuzzles* on chat.freenode.net.

We host the annual April Fool's Puzzle and Challenges every year on April 1st as part of our celebration for April Fool's Day.

History
-------

Prior to *#ircpuzzles*, a yearly festival of puzzles was created and managed by freenode staff.

*yano* participated among other staff in the adventure for several years, from 2012 to 2014.

In 2013, due to an overwhelming amount of volunteers and individuals who wanted to contribute, *yano* created *#ircpuzzles*.

*#ircpuzzles* was created as a way to run and manage future April Fool's Day competitions from non-freenode staff.

In 2014, *#ircpuzzles* held its first annual April Fool's Day Puzzle Competition. And #ircpuzzles has been hosting a yearly competition every April 1st since then.

And the rest is history.
